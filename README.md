Author: Benjamin Sams // Date: 01/04/2022 // 5.10 Portfolio Project

This is my portfolio project for Module 5 section 10 in the Engineering Flex course. It is meant to serve as an "online business card" and simplicity is the target theme. Below is the question/project requirements, and below that is a short summary of how I fulfill each requirement.

Requirements:
Your portfolio will be assessed based on the content and technical requirements outlined here. A grader from the Thinkful team will provide feedback based on these requirements in the grading rubric provided below. Links submitted via Repl.it will not be accepted and will require a resubmission.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Content requirements:
This portfolio will be reviewed by the Thinkful team. Specifically, they will look for the following in your portfolio website:

- HTML code that is semantic and valid

- CSS code that has been written by you, without the use of templates

- Content that is clear and readable

- An Intro section that contains the following information:

- Who you are

- Where you are located

- An About Me section that contains the following information:

- A description that shows your passion for web development and your willingness to work with others

- One or two sentences that describe other interests you have outside of web development

- A Contact section that contains the following information:

- A link to your LinkedIn profile

- A link to your GitHub profile

- A link to your email (optional)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technical requirements:
Your portfolio must be hosted on GitHub Pages, and it must include the following technical elements:

- Semantic containers like main, article, and footer

- Styled links using pseudo-classes

- Comments throughout your HTML and CSS that explain your code

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following HTML elements:

doctype, html, head, body, meta, title,
h1, h2, h3, p, link, ul, ol, img, a, hr

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following CSS properties:

background, color, font-family, font-size,
height, margin, padding, text-align

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fulfillment: 

All of the deliverables in the Content Requirements are fulfilled within the design of the website. The structure of the site is exactly as the question directs. The content reqirements section is essentially a brief summary of the webpage I've created.

In the Technical Requirements I use the semantic containers effectively, as well as using psedo-classes for my links (ex. line 260 in style.css). My README.md is very thorough in explaining what is happening here, and my styling classes all have some sort of reference to a semantic container. 

I did however, make the decision to omit the use of any lists. I feel as though the design/flow of my webpage really doesn't need lists. I can't think of a use for them, and I believe they would only clutter the flow of the page. All CSS properties are present in multiple places within the code.
